# Re: ELC2090 Project - Group 5:

It is required to design a power division network that divides the power among 2 loads satisfying the following specs at the design frequency:

●     Input and output matching.

●     Isolation between output ports.

●     Equal power division ratio.

Two designs of this network are to be proposed:

1)    Lumped components based design.

2)    Microstrip line based design.

Compare the performance of both implementations, supporting your comparison 
with relevant results and comments. Account for all discontinuities, 
junctions, bends… etc. in the microstrip version.

The Power divider is a device that divides input power into N ports with a designated power ratio. 
However, certain factors like Insertion loss, return loss, Isolation and Balancing between output ports must be considered for optimal performance in various applications. In RF and microwave applications, the Wilkinson power divider is commonly used to divide the input signal into two or more output signals with equal power. 
ZigBee, a wireless communication protocol, operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and is frequently used in low-power, low-data-rate applications such as home automation, industrial automation, and sensor networks. The Wilkinson power divider can be utilized in the context of 
ZigBee protocol to distribute RF power from a transmitter to multiple antennas, thereby improving the coverage and reliability of the ZigBee network. This is particularly useful when multiple ZigBee devices need to communicate over a wide area. Moreover, in ZigBee mesh networks where 
multiple devices act as routers and relay data between other devices, using a Wilkinson power divider to distribute RF power from a transmitter to multiple antennas can increase the range and coverage of each router and, therefore, improve the overall performance of the network. 
In summary, the Wilkinson power divider is a valuable component in ZigBee protocol applications that require the distribution of RF power to multiple antennas or devices. By evenly distributing RF power, the coverage and reliability of the ZigBee network can be improved, making it useful in applications such as home automation, industrial automation, and sensor networks.
